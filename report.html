        The focused audience of my website was those who like to bike within the Harrisonburg area. 
        Harrisonburg is very popular for mountain bikers and road riders so this "cohort" seemed pretty realistic to me. 
        Although I did stuggle with coming up with some of the content.

        I felt like the best part of my website is the header, as this is where most of my time developing was spent. 
        I love how it turned out with "active" class names to keep track of the current tab a user is on. Using media queries I was able to give it a responsive feel when the screen size went below 1000px. 
        At this point it would display a hanburger icon (from fontawesome) which allowed for a "drop down" that slides in from the left hand side of the screen.

    <li> images and css folders are used </li>
    <li> on the "Locations" page, users can hover over cards and get redirected to other sites
    </li>
    <li>With padding and spacing style, I believe the site is easy on the eyes and none of the text are hugging borders.</li> 
    <li>A "contact us" form is included with simple input boxes</li>
    <li>
        I will note that I fell short when addressing displays on smaller screens for other aspects of my website.
