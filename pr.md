I really like that when the window gets smaller, the nav bar changes to a button that shows a menu. Collapsing it like this should definitely help mobile users navigate the website.

I really like how on the locations page, when you hover over one of the maps it gets bigger to show that you are actively looking at it. It's a nice QOL feature that I wish I would have done on my site. I also like the color scheme on the site. The blue nav bar looks good and it probably looks better than mine.

Both of us followed the correct ways of structuring our files in the correct spots as well as following good code practices. I think they are both very maintainable. Though, as I say below I think that having more the one CSS file would make it easier to follow the style on each page.

The code is well structured with all files having the appropriate names. You included a CSS and images folder so those files are easy to access. I did notice that you only had one CSS file. I may be wrong about this but I was under the assumption that each page should have their own style sheet while also having one that handled the common theme among all the pages. Other than that, it looks great.

If I had one critique, it would be that almost all elements on the page had borders which I do not think is necessary. Obviously for some elements it makes it look nicer but too much can make it a little confusing to look at. For example, around some of the text on the "racing" page, the border didn't seem necessary to me but that is a personal design choice. I would make sure to add some spacing in between the border and the text though. On the "racing" page it definitely looks a little cramped.

Aside from what I already mentioned, the actual styles in the CSS page looks good. It's very easy to read and I do not see duplication.
